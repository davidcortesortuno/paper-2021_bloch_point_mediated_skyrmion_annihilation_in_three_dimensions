Experimental Data
=================

This folder contains data relevant to the experimental magnetometry data
presented in the manuscript *"Topological defect-mediated skyrmion
annihilation in three dimensions"* by Max T. Birch, David Cortés-Ortuño,
Nguyen D. Khanh, Shinichiro Seki, Aleš Štefančič, Geetha Balakrishnan,
Yoshinori Tokura & Peter D. Hatton.

Each subfolder contains data as follows:

**Supplementary_Fig1_Data** - Data measured after field cooling (FC) or zero
field cooling (FC) to the indicated temperature, for either increasing (up) or
decreasing (down) applied magnetic field. The data was used to plot the
magnetic phase diagrams shown in Fig. S2.

**AC_Susceptibility_FieldScans** - Data measured after field cooling (FC) or
zero field cooling (FC) to the indicated temperature, for either increasing
(up) or decreasing (down) applied magnetic field.

**Fig3B** - Lifetime measurements presented in Fig 3b. AC susceptibility
measured as a function of time at different applied magnetic fields. The sample
was initialised by field cooling under an applied field of 20 mT.

**Fig3C** - Lifetime measurements presented in Fig 3b. AC susceptibility
measured as a function of time at different applied magnetic fields and sample
temperatures. The sample was initialised by field cooling under an applied
field of 20 mT.
